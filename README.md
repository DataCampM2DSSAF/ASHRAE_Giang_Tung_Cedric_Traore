# Descriptions: 
This repository contains our group's work on the Kaggle competition: “ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III”. The details of this competition can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction.

With the given data of over 1000 buildings during a three-year period, our objective is predicting the efficiency of building energy usage in the areas: chilled, electric, hot water and water meter. 

This project started on January 22 and ended on March 31.
